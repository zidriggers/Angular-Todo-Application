# Angular-Todo-Application
 
Greetings!

This is a simple Web Application to demonstrate how to connect Angular and Spring Boot.
To run the application, please make sure you have applicable IDE's. The Angular project can be loaded onto Microsoft Visual Studio, and the Restful Web Service project can be loaded onto Eclipse or IntelliJ.

To run the Angular project, please make sure you have the latest version of Angular downloaded using Node.js. After that is confirmed, you need to use your terminal to set your directory onto the 'todo' folder, install the node_modules by running "npm install", and then type into the terminal "ng serve". This will load your Angular project onto http://localhost:4200/.

To run the Spring Application, after you have it loaded onto Eclipse or IntelliJ, be sure to run RestfulWebServicesApplication.java as a Java application. This Spring Application will then run on http://localhost:8080/.

Please do not update the ports these projects are running on, for the REST api calls are dependent on that.

Static user and database information is loaded into this program.
On the home screen, to log in you will need to use the username[validuser], and the password[dummypwd].

From there feel free to have fun, and see what this application has to offer.

For any questions, please email me at zacharydriggers.engineering@gmail.com
